[TXDB01] You are trying to forward to privileged ports (ports <= 1024). Most
operating systems restrict this to only privileged process (typically
processes running as an administrative user). This is a warning in case
the port forwarding doesn't work. If any problems occur, please try a
port higher than 1024.

[TXDB01] The guest additions on this VM do not match the installed version of
VirtualBox! In most cases this is fine, but in rare cases it can
prevent things such as shared folders from working properly. If you see
shared folder errors, please make sure the guest additions within the
virtual machine match the version of VirtualBox you have installed on
your host and reload your VM.

Guest Additions Version: 4.2.0
VirtualBox Version: 4.3
